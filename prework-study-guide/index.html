        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS</li>
          <li>An example of inline CSS is using the style attribute</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>The .js file extension indicates a javascript file</li>
          <li>We may see var from time to time as the keyword to create a variable</li>
          <li>Const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value</li>
          <li>We use an assignment variable like = to assign the specific data that we want stored in the variable</li>
          <li>JavaScript reads from top to bottom as part of its control flow.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data</li>
          <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential</li>
          <li>We use let, followed by a unique variable name and the assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
          <li>Unlike with const, let allows us to reassign the value of the variable over time.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
        </ul>
